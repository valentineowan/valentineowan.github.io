          <p class="lead">
            Lecturer in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Calabar. My teaching and research support centre on educational measurement and quantitative methods, with emphasis on scale development, validation, structural equation modelling, evaluation research, and academic publishing. My work bridges methodological training with applied data analysis and researcher development, guided by a strong commitment to transparency and responsible research practice. I actively mentor students and early-career academics in scholarly writing and publication, particularly in navigating submission, revision, and persistence in high-impact journals.

    <article class="card narrative">
      <p>
        Valentine Joseph Owan is a Lecturer in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Calabar, Nigeria.
        His academic work focuses on structural equation modelling, psychometrics, publication persistence, scholarly publishing,
        research productivity dynamics, and AI in research. Across these areas, his scholarship is guided by a strong commitment
        to methodological precision, analytical clarity, and responsible interpretation of quantitative evidence in educational
        and social research.
      </p>

      <p>
        His scholarly orientation developed through early research experiences characterised by rigorous supervision, sustained
        revision, and careful attention to conceptual organisation. These formative engagements cultivated enduring professional
        habits, including analytical discipline, clarity in academic writing, and close attention to citation accuracy and research
        ethics. They also shaped his sustained interest in research integrity, authorship responsibility, and fairness in scholarly publishing.
      </p>

      <p>
        His training pathway integrates formal academic study, extensive independent learning, and broad collaborative research engagement.
        He has contributed to research involving scale development and validation, latent-variable modelling, multivariate statistical analysis,
        institutional research, and investigations of research productivity. Much of his work connects advanced statistical techniques with
        practical questions concerning research engagement, academic publishing, and performance patterns in higher education.
      </p>

      <p>
        His academic perspective has also been informed by lived experience conducting research within resource-constrained environments.
        Encounters with infrastructural limitations, funding challenges, and publication barriers reinforced his commitment to journal literacy,
        ethical publication practice, and transparent methodological reporting. These experiences continue to shape his emphasis on rigour,
        clarity, and principled scholarship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Valentine actively leads and participates in multidisciplinary research collaborations supporting postgraduate researchers and
        early-career academics. Through mentoring, methodological guidance, and collaborative inquiry, he contributes to capacity development
        in quantitative methods, research design, academic writing, and publication planning. His mentoring philosophy prioritises intellectual
        honesty, patience in learning, and alignment between authorship credit and genuine scholarly contribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        His teaching approach reflects these same commitments. He emphasises conceptual understanding, methodological reasoning, and applied
        interpretation, encouraging students to progress beyond procedural familiarity toward analytical confidence, critical evaluation of
        evidence, and thoughtful engagement with statistical techniques.
      </p>

      <p>
        His research has appeared in peer-reviewed international journals indexed in major scholarly databases. He views research productivity
        not simply as publication output, but as a combination of ethical responsibility, collaborative contribution, methodological care,
        and sustained engagement in scholarly development.
      </p>

      <p>
        He remains committed to strengthening research culture, advancing methodological competence, promoting ethical authorship practices,
        and supporting equitable participation of African scholars in global knowledge production. His academic practice is anchored in careful
        analysis, transparent inquiry, and intellectual integrity.
